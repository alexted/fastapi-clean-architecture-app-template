## Scalability

Scalability is done by `Kubernetes` tools, by adding additional pods.
It is possible to scale by `granian`, by adding additional workers.

## Dependencies

pre-requisites:

```bash
$ poetry new {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} && cd $_        // create a project virtual environment
```

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
({{ cookiecutter.project_name }})$ poetry install                // install all project dependencies
({{ cookiecutter.project_name }})$ poetry install --only main    // install only main project dependencies
```

**Important**:
before running in a container, be sure to execute the ``poetry install'' command,
command to generate poetry.lock - this is the file from which information about dependencies is to be taken when
building the image.
You must also add this file to the git index.
